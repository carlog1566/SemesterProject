# SemesterProject
Restaurant Check Manager

This application manages restaurant checks and divides tips amongst workers.

The OriginalRestaurantCheckProject contains code for a tipping system that has a set amount of positions and tip percentages for each position.

The UpdatedTippingSystem folder contains code for a tipping system that allows you to choose which positions, number of workers in the position, and percentage tip for the position rather than having a set amount of positions and tip percentages.

Both have the same system for managing checks.
